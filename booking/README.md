# Airplane Booking System

REST API for multiple-seat booking

### Design description
I designed the code using the SOLID principles and the design patterns: repositories and services. 

Every controller has one work that's why I inject their main work in the class construct method when I need some work from another class I add it in the specific method using type hint. I keep the controllers clean, I use them just to point who has to work, repository or the service, and to deliver the response. 

I use the repositories to isolate the database connections so I can have better control and can have a better organization of complex queries. 

I use the services to isolate and keep the business rules

For this solution I developed 3 object classes:

    - Bookings, to keep all the bookings and control the application of the rules
    - Row, to keep the seats and other rows as a node inside a node so I can have recursive access to them
    - Seat, to control if it is occupied or is on window

So I have the Booking Service which manage these 3 classes to do the bookings.

### Possible enhancements
    - Login system
    - canceling system
    - Bookings by date
    - Friendly url
    - Register the passenger with a personal id
    - State design pattern to manage the rules

### Tecnologies
    - Laravel 8
    - Mysql 8
    - Docker

### Instructions 

Get in the docker directory and execute. It may take a while
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

After the first step finishes execute the comands:
```sh
$ docker container exec -it php-fpm composer install \
    && docker container exec -it php-fpm cp .env.example .env \
    && docker container exec -it php-fpm php ./artisan key:generate \
    && docker container exec -it php-fpm php ./artisan config:cache \
    && docker container exec -it php-fpm php ./artisan migrate:fresh --seed \
    && docker container exec -it php-fpm php ./artisan db:seed --class=ShortRangeAircraftSeeder \
    && docker container exec -it php-fpm composer dump-autoload \
    && docker container exec -it php-fpm php ./artisan optimize:clear
```


Now the system might have been available on the following link: http://localhost 


Execute the tests
```sh
$ docker container exec -it php-fpm ./artisan test
```
